# WASH AND DIE part 2: Out of Order / Eat and Fuck Part Two
## Tug Job Grandma - <!-- STATUS: edit 3 -->

Matt Lamott was born to mop. 

He is painting a portrait of life, laughter, love and labor on the floor of THE CLOTHING CLEANING STORE. Swaying gently from side to side, Matt works his masterpiece, executing precise, magnificent strokes with his long-handled paintbrush.

A naked man shivers near a dryer in which his sodden clothes are tumbling. "You sure do like moppin'," he says to Matt.

"I'm not mopping," Matt says. "I'm painting."

Matt kisses the handle of his mop and whispers to it, "Shh ... don't listen to that naked shivering man. You are a paintbrush. And I am your artist."

"You are an asshole," the man says.

"No shirt, no shoes, no shit-talking," Matt responds.
  
He pulls a pair of Laundra's panties from his pocket. He mops his sweaty brow and admires all his hard work. The scratched, worn floor shines and smiles back. 		

"Damn," Matt says. "You could fuck a dirty whore on that clean floor." He tugs at the handle of his mop.

Matt appreciates this time without Laundra, but he also can't wait to see her when she gets back from her latest clothing cleaning seminar. She's Matt's new drug. 

"I love that kinky slut," he says as he touches his dick with the handle of his mop. 

The naked shivering man shakes his head in disgust and abruptly falls into a phlegmy fit of coughing.

> "COFFINS! COFFINS! COFFINS!"

The wall-mounted TV flickers on and coughs to life.

> A fat man stuffed inside an open coffin shouts:    

> "Come on down to COLLIN'S COFFINS!    
Your one-stop shop for tight wood box!    
Buy three coffins and get one small coffee,    
Absolutely free of charge!   
Act now!   
Man is but mortal!   
This box is your portal.   
Don't be a clown,     
Quit fuckin' around!    
Listen to the sound    
Of death knocking on your door.   
WAIT--that's not death!   
That's Collin, Collin from COLLIN'S COFFINS!   
He just wants to sell you a coffin!   
What's the problem?   
You don't like Collin?    
Collin's a-callin'   
Quit stallin'!    
Get your ass off the floor   
And open that door!    
Don't be sore;   
Come on down to the coffin store!   
What's that store?   
The coffin store!   
COLLIN's COFFINS!   
COFFINS! COFFINS! COFFINS!"  

Coughing uncontrollably, the wall-mounted TV spits up static. It heaves and retches until it pushes out a greasy glob of granny giggling.

> Laundra's toothless grandma cackles endlessly. She is old and haunting, her face like a wrinkly linen shirt under a tight, powdery halo of permed purple hair. 

> "TUG JOB GRANDMA tugs the dicks off desperate derelicts to bring you TUG JOB[^b] GRANDMA'S COLD CHUNKY SOUP!" the TV screams. 

[^b]: Urban Dictionary definition of TUG JOB: A tug occurs when a special bond between two people leads to under-the-table extra curricular activities involving the gentle stroking of the penis using the hands and/or feet.     
*"Honey, I hope that you haven't forgotten that today is two-tug-Tuesday"      
"There's nothing I love better than giving you a tug job with my hands and/or feet on two-tug-Tuesday!"*     

> Grandma upends a dented tin can, pouring greasy, thick, chunky brown slop onto a plate.

> "You're going to love TUG JOB GRANDMA'S COLD CHUNKY SOUP!"

> Grandma slowly dips her broken-twig forefinger into the plate of soup and lifts it toward her mouth. Her hand shakes violently, casting off the slop before she can taste it. She tries again, smearing the soup around the plate with her crooked, gnarly finger, spilling it over the edges and onto the brown checkered tablecloth. Again the slop drips from her finger before she can get it into her mouth. A look of intense frustration comes over her and she presses the palm of her hand down into the plate of cold chunky goop. She giggles and hops up and down in her seat with excitement as she clenches and unclenches her rheumy fist, squeezing the brown slop between her fingers and spilling it generously onto the table. Grandma lifts her hand to her face. She shakes and trembles. The chunky, greasy brown slop splashes back onto the plate. She licks her shaking palm with her dry, leathery tongue. There is enough soup caught in the folds of flesh and between her fingers for her to get a taste, even though most of the goop dribbles down her chin and spatters her blouse before falling onto the floor.

> Grandma closes her eyes and moans. She moans for a very long time. 

> "DELISH!" she shrieks, thrusting her finger into the air.

The word DELISH rings around inside Matt's head like a pair of wet panties tumbling in a dryer. It slides down his throat like panties flushed down a toilet. His belly growls. He rubs it slowly, gently, passionately. 

"DELISH!" Matt says, thrusting his finger into the air.

"I'm hungry," says the naked shivering man waiting for his clothes to dry.

Matt is touched by TUG JOB GRANDMA. He appreciates her struggle and poor oral hygiene. Tonguing his chipped tooth, he is filled with all sorts of emotions. He even knows the names of some of them.

Matt leans his mop against the wall and heads out to buy dinner. Laundra will be home soon.

## Laundra's Dreams <!-- STATUS: edit 3 -->

Matt and Laundra sit on a pile of clothing in the middle of THE CLOTHING CLEANING STORE, completely naked, except for the socks on their feet--his are pink, hers are yellow. They shovel carne asada fries into their carnivorous horny mouths. 

Matt and Laundra have been eating carne asada fries every night for the past three weeks. They can't stop this roller coaster ride of deliciousness. 

They deep throat sloppy fistfuls of freaky french fries, beefy beefcake beef steak and great big bowl, eh? of sleazy greazy guacamole, on their knees begging *please* for a sticky squeeze of nacho cheese. 

"Fill me up, slut." Laundra says. 

"Huh?" Matt crinkles his brow.

"I'm talking to the fries," she clarifies. 

Matt smiles. He's feeling something he hasn't felt in he-doesn't-know-how-long. He's feeling something more than an upset stomach.

"DELISH!" he shouts around a mouthful of sour cream. He thrusts a fry into the air. Matt doesn't even like sour cream. 

Laundra scolds half-heartedly, "Don't talk with your mouth full, bitch."

Matt can't stop smiling. It's not easy to find a lover who shows her affection through verbal abuse. 

Matt has a boner, and he isn't sure if he should stick his dick into Laundra or the carne asada fries. He hasn't had an appetite like this for ages. 

"How're your fries?" Matt asks.

"Better than sex," Laundra says. 

Matt chuckles. Laundra chuckles. And then a couple of grandmas chuckle. They stand near the dryers, watching Matt and Laundra. 

Matt is perturbed. He hadn't noticed them. He was too caught up in carne asada goodness. 

"What are they doing?" Matt asks, pointing at the wrinkly old women. 

"Cleaning clothes," Laundra says. 

"Do they watch us fuck?" Matt asks. "How many grandmas do you have?" 

Laundra shrugs her shoulders, eats more fries. 

Matt shrugs his shoulders, eats more fries. 

"I love this place," Matt says. Sour cream and carne asada grease drip down his chin. He wipes his hands on a bra beneath his butt.

Laundra mops a stream of cream from Matt's chin with a handful of fries and shoves them into her mouth. "This place sucks," she says, shrugging her shoulders. "But I'm going to change that. My landlord's going to let me on his TV program--he's giving away twenty grand! That money is going to make this place beautiful. Respectable. People will come from all over the city to wash their clothes. With twenty grand I could--"

"Fuck twenty grand," Matt says. "Fuck respectable. 'Respectable' people don't live in SHIT CITY. They live up on PENIS HILL, and they stay up on PENIS HILL. Fuck 'em. Fuck PENIS HILL. Fuck your landlord."

"Fuck *you,* Matt. You're just an angry drunk. You don't tell me who to fuck. I'm so tired of people like you shitting on my dreams like some crackhead shitting in one of my washers."  

"Crackhead shit gets the stains out, Laundra." Matt says. "And I am not a drunk."

<!-- 2013-12-18 | 17:57:16 -->

## Matt and Laundra Eat and Fuck  <!-- STATUS: edit 3 --> 

In his dream, Matt fucks Laundra doggy style[^doggystyle] on a bed of carne asada fries. A mob of grandmas surround the bed, chanting and whooping and pumping their fists. Instead of permed purple hair, their heads are capped with creamy coifs of guacamole. Matt reaches out and takes a swipe at one of the grandmas' gooey green pompadours. He licks his finger like an opera singer.

[^doggystyle]: Doggy style, also called doggie style or the rear-entry position, is a sex position in which a person bends over, crouches on all fours (usually on hands and knees), or lies on their stomach, for sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration. Non-penetrative sex in this position may also be regarded as doggy style sex. When between sex partners, the person in the doggy style position is passive or submissive, while the other partner is active or dominant. The passive partner is open to a variety of sexual activities, with the active partner being able to penetrate the vagina, or anus during anal sex, as well as having the option of performing oral sex (cunnilingus, fellatio or analingus).

"DELISH!" he shouts in ecstasy. 

As Matt slams his penis into Laundra, Laundra slams a fistful of carne asada fries into her mouth. She moans with delight. 

"Bitch, who's your landlord now?" Matt says. But he wonders if Laundra's feelings for him are as strong as her feelings for carne asada fries. 

"Let's be honest," Laundra grunts. "No man can compete with a crippling order of carne asada fries." 

Self-doubt clamps down on Matt. It claws at his dehydrated calf, which seizes into a painful cramp. Matt dismounts, moaning and writhing in pain. He curls up in the fetal position and frantically rubs sour cream into the flesh of his cramped leg. 

Laundra smiles and sighs peacefully. She sits up on her knees to attend to Matt. She massages his calf as he cries out. She moves down to his foot and gently tugs his big toe backward. 

Matt groans with immediate and ecstatic relief. "DELISH!" he cries as he squirts himself in the chest with a load of his own sour cream. 

He uncurls and pulls Laundra into a sticky embrace. They kiss and settle comfortably into the greasy bed of carne asada fries, floating high above the stench and depravity of SHIT CITY. Guacamole-crowned grandmas hover like cherubs in the sky nearby.

---

Matt awakes to a sleeping Laundra at his side. He sits up to see if any carne asada fries are left. No such luck. He lies back down and stares at the ceiling, letting his mind wander off. He's parched. He needs a drink. 

Matt quietly gets up and tiptoes past three grandmas peacefully snoring on the floor. He reaches surreptitiously into a dryer marked with an out-of-order sign and pulls out a bottle of swill. He takes a couple of swigs and swishes the fiery stuff around his mouth. 

Matt slips the bottle back into its secret spot and sneaks back to the nest of clothing. He scratches idly at his dick while sniffing Laundra's hair.

"To wash or not to wash?" Matt whispers. 

"Wash and die," three grandmas whisper in the dark. 

---

## Out of Order <!-- STATUS: edit 3 -->

Matt wakes up to the sound of his own voice. He is in the middle of an argument with Laundra. "Bitch, wine *stains* clothes," he says. 

Laundra frowns. "Bitch, you haven't been listening to anything I've said." She's not wearing any clothes. 

Matt's not wearing any clothes either. Realizing this, he covers his crotch. Matt doesn't remember getting undressed. Across the room, he sees five naked grandmas folding clothes. Five? They're like an aggressive cancer.

Laundra's tone irritates him. Or maybe it's the way she's using the word 'bitch' now. It started out so sweet and endearing. It had made him laugh. But now it feels like a congealed bullet of phlegm spat into his face.

"Lucius says we need to let go of our outdated ideas about stains," she says. 

"Lucius?" Matt says.

"Lucius is my landlord. Lucius is a genius. Lucius says we're obsessed with the idea that white is clean. White isn't clean though. It's just a color. Lucius says burgundy is the new white. Isn't that amazing?"

Matt is not amazed. Laundra has been attending more and more clothing cleaning seminars, and Matt is tired of hearing about them. 

"No, bitch," Matt spits. "That is *not* amazing. I like wearing *white* shirts. I don't like wearing wine-stained stupid burgundy shirts."  

"Bitch, please. *You* like wearing *dirty* shirts." Laundra likes putting emphasis on certain words in her speech. 

"Hey, remember last night? When I accidentally jammed my penis into the side of *your* leg? *That* was dirty ... and a little painful." Matt scratches his dick. It's raw and sore. Laundra's use of emphasis on certain words in her speech is rubbing off on him.

"Lucius says his TV program is the answer to all our problems."

"Lucius says my dick hurts," Matt snaps.

"Lucius works with struggling business owners and helps them prepare for the coming of the new era, Matt."

"That sounds sleazy," Matt says.

"Bitch, Lucius is a genius. I'm going to be on his program, and it's going to change my life."

"Bitch, you don't need some stupid TV program to change your life."

"I'll start by fixing that sign," she says, gesturing to the soft glow of the neon shining through the window.

<div class="center">
**THE \ LOTHING CLEANING S ORE**
</div>

"Shouldn't Lucius fix that sign without forcing you to do some stupid TV thing? That sounds like ... what's the word? Embezzlement?" Matt wishes he wouldn't have dropped out of college. 

"Extortion, dummy. Bitch."

"Whatever. You don't need Lucius," Matt says. "You've got me. Why don't you ask me for help? I'd do anything for you."

"Bitch, what are you gonna do for me? You can't help me. Even your hair is sloppy. Lucius has the most amazing flattop," Laundra coos.

"Alright, Laundra!" Matt says. "Enough about stupid fucking Lucius and his stupid fucking flattop. I don't want to hear about it," he says, crossing his arms and turning away from her. 

"Aww ... does Baby need a tug-tug?" Laundra reaches toward Matt's crotch, but he pushes her away.

Laundra glares at him. "Flip the switch, bitch," she says. "Your jealousy is a real turn-off." 

And just like that, the machines in the store start to turn off, one by one. 

"What's going on?" Matt says. 

"Maybe the power's down. I'll call Lucius," Laundra says. 

"No!" Matt shouts. "I can handle this!"

He runs over to one of the washing machines and slaps his dick back and forth across its control panel.

"Bitch," Matt yells. 

He runs around THE CLOTHING CLEANING STORE, his little dick swinging. "I can handle this!"

He bangs on a second machine, slapping his dick on its lid. "I can handle this!" 

He runs over to a dryer and crams his scrotum into the scalding hot lint trap. 

"What the fuck are you doing, Matt?" Laundra shouts. "I'm calling Lucius."

"Bitch!" he yells. "I AM PRESENTLY IN THE MOMENT HANDLING THIS!"

Laundra looks around and lets out a sigh. "Bitch, this place is a shithole." 

And then the television flickers on.

## Lucius appears on TV <!-- STATUS: edit 3 -->

> Lucius is on his hands and knees in a room full of washers and dryers. 

> He lowers his face to inspect the gap beneath one of the big steel front-loaders. He turns to the camera with a look of disgust.

> "Smells fucking disgusting down here, like somebody came inside a rat that crawled under here to die. When was the last time you cleaned under here, you filthy yellow tapeworm?" He asks.

> A Chinese woman stands stammering and shamed. "I ... I ... I ..." she says. "Last week." 

> "Bull fucking shit you slimy Green-Banded Broodsac.[^broodsac] Look at this." Lucius lifts the machine off the ground with one hand, tilting it back with impossible ease. With his other hand, he reaches into the dark gap below the machine and scrapes up a handful of brown fuzzy sludge. "You should be ashamed of yourself," Lucius says.

[^broodsac]: A freaky mind-control parasite that forces snails to wander out onto the highest, most exposed perch they can find, and turns their eye stalks into giant pulsating phalluses that lure birds to come along and eat them up. 'Cause the Broodsac wants to get in the bird's belly. Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGyvlt_b3is), or read more [here](http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Leucochloridium_paradoxum.html)
 
> The woman stands shocked and embarrassed. 

> Lucius lets the machine drop to the ground with a thundering boom and he gets up and shouts in the woman's face. "A fucking week? Bullshit. You fucking filthy foreign bag of filth. You should be ashamed of yourself!" 

> She tries to explain herself, but he doesn't let her speak.

> "I don't want to hear your excuses, you dirty parasite." He rubs the brown sludge into her face and hair. He rips open her blouse and smears her breasts with the foul slime.

"That's Lucius!?" Matt says. "That's the guy that chipped my tooth! Threw a quarter right in my face! And ... there's something else ... something familiar about him. But I don't think I've seen this program before. Where have I--" 

Laundra touches her vagina. "Bitch, shut up," she says. 

She gets down on her hands and knees, reaches under one of her front-loaders, and tries to clean the gap down below the machine.

"Bitch, help me," Laundra says. "Lift this thing up so I can get in under there and clean it out, bitch." 

Matt leans his whole body into the machine, pushing so hard that his toenails scrape into the tile floor. He lifts with his arms. He lifts with his back. He lifts with his thighs. He lifts with his heart. It isn't enough. The machine is far too heavy for him. 

How does Lucius do it?

---

## Matt gets Jealous and Irritable <!-- STATUS: edit 3 -->

Matt stares at his mop from across the room. He touches his dick. He is alone--save for the gaggle of grandmas--in THE CLOTHING CLEANING STORE. Laundra is at another seminar. The floor isn't that dirty. He'll mop later. He could go for a beer. He should start lifting weights so he can lift these machines up. 

"Drinking problem?" he thinks aloud. Where does Laundra get off telling him *he* has a drinking problem? She's the one obsessed with wine ... wine and Lucius. 

Matt addresses the flock of grandmas folding fabrics, "Do I have a drinking problem?" 

The grandmas stare. There are at least a dozen of them now. 

"What the fuck are you old birds looking at?" He waves an arm. "Fold those rags." Matt turns his back on the grandmas and stares out the storefront windows.

"I don't have a drinking problem," Matt says. "Laundra's got a bitching problem. Always grinding her toothy dick hole into my face, bitching about my dirty fingernails, the holes in my socks, my chipped fucking tooth, my dirty fucking boner." 

Matt turns around to shout at the grandmas. "Fuck! Shit! Cunt! Guacamole!" he says.

"Sheesh." Matt eyes the grandmas to make sure they aren't watching before slowly lifting the lid of an out-of-order washer. He pulls out a can of DETERGENT Malt Liquor: Malt Liquor For Men Who Drink DETERGENT Malt Liquor! 

He takes a sip from the hot, sweaty can. 

The fillings in his molars crackle like sparklers. He spasms and gasps and loses his shit.

He runs out into the street, clutching the can in his raised fist, splashing himself on the head with the sauce. 

He shouts to the heavens, "I am a man! For I drink DETERGENT Malt Liquor: Malt Liquor For Men Who Drink DETERGENT Malt Liquor!

"Damn thee, cruel and morbid gods! Deliver unto me the shit-stained corpse of that flea-ridden scoundrel, **Lucius the Landlord.**

"Who is this landlord? What lord of what land is he?

"I am the lord of this land!   
This land that is this can     
held in my hand,   
for I am a man    
and I take what I can!    
You understand?     
Who sips from this holy can?    
I can drink from this can!   
In my dreams I saw Lucius in Iran--   
or was it that I ran?   

"I don't agree with the Utilitarianism of Ayn Rand.   
I love the beach, but I hate the sand.   

"I remember the first time I came in my hand:   
it was like jelly--NAY! scratch that--it was jam!   
I was sixteen, and a dancer for the band,    
SOFT FLUFFY, a mediocre country and western band.

"The singer--whose name was Muffy--was in love with an 80-year old man.   
The old man was a frail old music stand.    
His name was Dave, but we called him Dan.    

"Like Michael Jackson's glove     
inside of Peter Pan,    
it was a forbidden love.    

"The critics panned us.    
The promoters banned us   
from all the clubs in all the land.

"Dan made moonshine in the hot hot heat of the sun.   
His bland and juicy nog gave us all the runs.   
We were a banned band with the runs!    
And with that, I think I'm done.    

"LUCIUS! I SHALL SLAY THEE!     
Before the end of this novel, I shall Slay Thee!   
Before many mangled manigold marigold maidens of malicious malevolent melancholy manatees.    
Thou shalt be dead.

"Is manigold a word?

"I am not drunk. 

"I am lord of the sober!

"The sober-toothed tigered. 

"I am tigered!

"So very, very ... tigered."

Matt blinks the sleep from his eyes.

"Deliver ... deliver me ... into my rightful place.

"Deliver unto me a ... a bed ... and a ... and ..."

Matt sucks back the rest of the DETERGENT Malt Liquor: Malt Liquor For Men Who Drink DETERGENT Malt Liquor! 

He crushes the can in his fist and chucks it into the gutter. He flips it off and goes back into THE CLOTHING CLEANING STORE.

Matt's fine. He's just fine. 

---

The other day Matt had to evict a family of grandmas from their nest in the rafters. He stood on top of one of the triple-load washers and waved his mop around to shoo them away. They took off with a noisy clapping sound and Matt destroyed their flimsy stick-and-debris nests, smashing them to pieces with his mop.  

Matt now observes the bony-bodied grandmas work their gizzards as they clean their clothes. He wonders what would happen if he threw a handful of seed on the floor. The grandmas make soft murmuring sounds as they wash and dry. 

One of the grandmas coughs up and spits out a large glob of phlegm into her yellowed negligee. Using her two thumbs, she massages the phlegm into the threadbare fabric. 

"Get those stains out, you wretched old bird-slut," Matt yells. "You make me fucking sick and maybe a teeny tiny bit horny. But only in a curious, empty, lonely sort of way." He's amazed at how many of them can fit inside the store. They are nasty and impolite, and they are all identical. 

Matt fantasizes about beating a few of them with a hammer. They'd squeal and flap their liver-spotted arms. 

Matt touches his dick. 

A flash of lightning draws Matt out of his thoughts.
He turns to watch the gooey shit-rain drip down the storefront windows. 

Matt thinks about Laundra, and gooey shit-rain seeps into his head. He thinks about Lucius. Lucius sounds lecherous. 

Fucking Lucius. Fucking Laundra. Lucius Fucking Laundra.

Matt scowls at his reflection in the shit-streaked glass.

He bares his freshly brushed yellow teeth[^teeth] and stares at the chip in his front tooth. His gums are raw and bleeding from neglect.

[^teeth]: Here's a great inexpensive way to make your teeth look whiter: replace your bright white light bulbs with dimmer, yellower light bulbs! You are *so* welcome.

Fucking Lucius. 

Every time Matt closes his eyes, Lucius is there. He throws a quarter at Matt's face. Over and over, the disk smashes into Matt's mouth. The pain comes searing through the broken-record memory and tingles into Matt's jaw and down his spine. 

His impotent rage boils. 

Matt grabs his mop. He'll fucking mop the fucking floor even though it's still pretty fucking clean. Fuck it. He'll make the fucker shine. He'll mop the floor until it fucking bleeds.

And so he mops. 

And he mops away the dirty streaks of love grease. 

And the floor shines. 

A tremendous flash of lightning from the raging storm outside rattles the storefront windows. 

A sopping wet grandma in moth-eaten mittens and mangy furs splashes through the door. Behind her, the sky is being crushed to death by massive black thunderheads.

She drags a soggy bag of soiled silks, satins and synthetics across the clean floor. She leaves the door open, allowing a surge of wind, sour rain and squishy garbage to swoosh in behind her.
	  
"Keep the door closed!" Matt yells. 
	  
The grandma flips Matt off with her flea-bitten middle finger and turns away. 

Matt licks his chipped tooth. 

He swings his mop like a great long-handled hammer. Rain and scraps of newspaper swirl around him. 

Thunder cracks and a flash of lightning illuminates the moment of impact, revealing the wet head of the mop slapping across the loose-leather face of the grandma. 

She falls down, stunned. A scuzzy pair of granny panties falls from her sack onto the floor. 

Matt stares at the shit-stains on the granny panties. The panties are red with black polka dots, like a ladybug. He spits on them. 

Matt looks up to find he is surrounded by a gaggle of scaly grandmas, all flipping him off. They murmur disapprovingly as they shuffle back and forth, shifting their weight from foot to foot.

"You tatty, moth-eaten cunts!" Matt yells. 

He runs to close the door and leans his weight into it, fighting the force of the storm. A fierce bolt of lightning strikes a homeless person dead in the street before Matt can push the door closed.

## Matt struggling with depression <!-- STATUS: edit 3 --> 

Matt reaches into another out-of-order washer and pulls out a half-finished forty of DETERGENT Malt Liquor: Malt Liquor For Men Who Drink DETERGENT Malt Liquor! He takes a swig to calm his nerves. 

"Fuck it," Matt mumbles, taking another swig.

He leans against the washing machine, listening to the hum of the dryers, listening to the murmur of his heart.

"My trust has been frayed by life," he says. "Maybe it's my own fault. Maybe I washed my pure white trust with the brightly colored rags of my many failures, and ruined the whole load of clothes that is my pathetic life."

Matt takes another swig, but there's nothing left. He sits down on the dirty linoleum floor next to his mop bucket. He hugs it. It's filthy. All his mopping has been for nothing. He feels sorry for himself. Too sorry to get back up. Too sorry to mop the floor. 

He pushes the empty forty down into the bucket of mop water. The bottle goes GLUG GLUG GLUG, filling with greasy black liquid.   

Matt feels like he's drowning. There's no point. Clothes were made to be dirty. Life is dirty. Matt is dirty. Dirty is dirty.

He takes a swig from his forty and gags on a mouthful of swampy mop scum.

He retches and pours the rest of his forty out onto the floor.

"Fuck you," he shouts. "Dirty fucking floor."

Life be damned. Love be damned. Clothing be damned. Laundra be damned. Lucius be damned. Matt be damned. Damned be damned.

<!-- The only way to be honest and clean is to be homeless and filthy like the rest of the flea-ridden vagrant scum living on the streets, sucking on the shit-caked sidewalks. Matt wasn't made of durable material. He has always known this. It's why he has always run away. Retarded riff-raff on the run. -->

## Laundra talks to Matt about his Drinking <!-- STATUS: edit 3 -->

Matt is lonely. He feels used. Laundra is never around. She puts Matt to work and takes off for her seminars. She treats him like a piece of meat, fucks him whenever she wants and doesn't give two shits about Matt. 

"I need a beer," Matt says.

Lucius is a sleazy man-whore. He'd fuck anything. Everything. He's probably touching Laundra right now. Using her as an example in his stupid fucking seminar. 

Matt leans his mop against the bank of machines and reaches into one of the large dryers. He pulls out a 40 oz.[^40] bottle of DETERGENT Malt Liquor: Malt Liquor For Men Who Drink DETERGENT Malt Liquor! He twists off the top and drinks a long draught of the precious golden fluid, trying in vain to slake his bottomless thirst.

[^40]: 1182.94 ml

<!-- TODO: Put the 40 oz. footnote everywhere.  -->

Matt can picture it, like a pop-up book open on his lap: Lucius calls Laundra to the stage at the front of the packed auditorium. He's got a really nice flattop. It sparkles and shines like a cut diamond in the stage lights. It is easily the nicest flattop ever. 

Lucius and Laundra stand next to a monstrous contraption--a wine barrel with levers and portholes and hoses and cables. Lucius puts his hand on Laundra's shoulder and whispers into her ear.

Laundra takes her panties off and hands them to Lucius. 

<!-- TODO: globally replace all panty references to unified panty epithet (polka dot or ladybug?) -->

He presses them to his face, inhaling deeply. His eyes roll back into his head, marveling at the beauty of his own flattop seen from inside his own head. 

"Observe," Lucius says as he holds the panties up for the audience to see. He rips them apart. "The fabric, in it's natural state, is *weak*." 

He opens a porthole in the wine barrel contraption and flings the panties inside. "Now, we wait," he says. "In a few minutes, I'll demonstrate the awesome structural reinforcing power of my patented wine-washing process."

"How long will it take?" asks Laundra.

"Just long enough," says Lucius. "My flattop is strong." He pushes Laundra face-down onto a bed of silk sheets, lifts her skirt up over her hips and begins to cover the back of her thighs with his saliva.

Goddamn. What a flattop. 

That top is seriously flat. 

Flattop. 

It's so hot right now.    

---

The strand of bells hanging by the front door of THE CLOTHING CLEANING STORE jingles, drawing Matt out of his pop-up book nightmare. 

He quickly caps his 40 and chucks it into a running dryer. The bottle thuds and clangs inside the machine as it turns. 

Laundra waltzes in with an order of carne asada fries and a smile. 

"Matt, you look terrible." Laundra sets the carne asada fries on top of a washer. "What's wrong?" She touches Matt's shoulder.

Matt belches and stumbles and steadies himself against a dryer. His eyes cross and uncross.

"Are you drunk?" Laundra asks.

"Huh?" Matt burps again.

The sound of glass exploding followed by a terrible hissing and boiling noise plus the sound of metal grinding into metal and fabric tearing and steam whistling and a loud clang followed by a louder CLANG and then the smell of cooking beer smashes their conversation to bits before it can get started.

"What the fuck was that?" Laundra says, shoving Matt out of her way. "It stinks like a brewery." 

She opens what remains of the dryer door and pulls out the broken pieces of Matt's 40. "Goddamn it, Matt," she says. "Do you know how much this is going to cost me?"

"I'll make it better," Matt says.

"You can't make it better," Laundra says. "I can't keep doing this!"

Matt burps and touches his dick. 

"You've got to straighten out, bitch." Laundra slaps Matt. "Your drinking is getting in the way of your mopping. Stop touching your dick!

"If you are serious about this ... if you want to work here, fuck me and hone your mopping skills, you have got to lay off the booze. Stop drinking, Matt. The craft of mopping requires dedication. Hone your mopping skills, or it's over between us.

Matt wobbles back and forth. He reaches toward her, to put his arm around her, but she pushes him away. 

Her eyes are wet and gleaming. She looks down at the floor. Matt's bare feet are crusted in filth.

"Where's your socks, Matt?"

"I don't know," Matt lies.

Earlier, Matt traded his socks for an empty bottle of whiskey. 

"I'll get new socks," he says. "I can do it. I ... I can get new socks ... I know I can do it. I'm also gonna take the craft of mopping to the next level for you. I'm gonna take it all the way, Baby."

Matt touches his dick.

"Just ... just stop drinking, Matt," Laundra says. "And *stop* touching your dick!"

"I'll find some socks and I'll clean myself up--I'll get a haircut," Matt says, touching his dick, loving Laundra and thinking of Lucius. 

## UGG Boots - Do You Believe in Love? - <!-- STATUS: edit 3 -->

Matt heads out into the rain. He knows where to find some socks. Shoes too. Sally in the Alley. The whore corpse from the other day. 

Somebody had tried to chop her up with a hatchet, from the looks of her. She had these nice big feet in these big beautiful UGG boots. She probably had socks on too. 

Matt flounders, trying to remember where he found her. Flies were all around her. In which alley had he found the corpse of Sally? On the other side of PENIS HILL in VAGINA VALLEY? 

The hard rain stings his eyes. The smell of wet garbage sticks to the roof of his mouth. He's getting close. He can feel it. 

He touches his dick. 

A septuagenarian hooker wearing shredded tights, a miniskirt and a fold of leather masquerading as a jacket cracks a broken-toothed smile at Matt as he approaches.

Matt acknowledges the saggy-skinned skeletal sex-worker with a nod. "Not tonight, Methuselah," he says. "I'm looking for a friend."

She spits blood at his feet.

He turns away and shuffles down the street.

"Sally?" he calls. "Where are you, Sally? I need your help. You're my only hope." He stumbles into a trash-strewn alley.

The rain stops. 

Sunbeams slice through the storm clouds and dance over a refuse-strewn wasteland.

Flies are thick in the air. 

This is the place. The garbage-strewn place. 

"Sally?" Matt calls again. He starts riffling desperately through a mountain of garbage. "Sally! My feet are naked.

My feet are naked and they hurt, Sally.

They hurt like ... like my heart.

Laundra says I need to cover my feet. Laundra says ... Laundra says ... wait ... I sense a disturbance in the trash."

Matt pauses and sniffs the air. He tilts his head and listens. There is a sound coming from deep within the trash.

What kind of a sound is that? Matt wonders. He makes a list in his mind:

1. Animal sound.
2. Ruccus.
3. Bang.
4. Pitter.
5. Patter.
6. Tootlecrackagitation.
7. Flump.

Whatever it was, Matt definitely heard one of those seven sounds.  

"Did you hear that too, Sally? Aww ... who gives a shit?" Matt crumples up his mental list and swallows it. "Why does Laundra bitch at me all the time, Sally? Sally, what is love?"

Sally knows about love. She knows so much about love it's killed her. Killed her with a hatchet.

"Oh shit. I think I stepped in rat shit."

Matt moves on. 

<!-- TODO: revisit the SALLY scene in part one -->

"Laundra doesn't love me. She loves cleaning clothes," Matt says. "She cleans clothes even when they don't need cleaning. There's a washer running in her heart and a dryer in her mind."

Matt pulls away more trash to reveal Sally's dead hooker face framed in rotten vegetables and cooking waste. "There you are," he says. He smiles.

"I don't know, Sally," Matt says. "I just want ... I want to be loved. To be needed. But she is so hung up on her business. She doesn't need anything. She certainly doesn't need me. She is so strong. I am so weak."

Matt tilts his head and listens, staring deeply into Sally's puffy, pock-marked face. Her ear has been chewed away by vermin. Coffee grounds--used up and discarded from a nearby diner--stick to her face and gather in the pits of her eyes, making it look like she's been crying, causing her mascara to run.

"Well, yeah," Matt says. "If I had to define it, I guess that's our relationship. She's the strong one. I'm the weak one. I'm the damaged one. I never learned how to trust. Laundra doesn't have time for trust. Laundra's the strong one."

Matt is hungry and horny. He touches his dick as he listens. 

"Well ... I don't know, Sally," Matt says. "You think she's afraid to show her love? She isn't afraid of anything. She's ... she's like a machine. Just when I think I know how to make her happy, when I think I've figured out how to tickle her vagina just the right way ..."

Matt flutters his fingers in the air, as if he were tickling the chin of a bearded chimp. 

"... she won't let me touch her any more. She'd rather bitch instead. She likes to grind her toothy dick hole into my face and bitch about my dirty fingernails, the holes in my socks, my chipped tooth and my dirty boner." 

Matt laughs maniacally. "You like that, Sally, don't you? Toothy dickhole. Yeah, I'm pretty funny sometimes." 

Matt idly thumbs through the garbage as he talks, as if he were browsing for unsung treasure at a garage sale.

Matt laughs again. He chokes on his spittle. He coughs and gags and spits a gob of custard onto his sleeve. He looks at it with wide-eyed wonder. It is yellow with little red veins. He pokes at it with his finger. He flicks it gently, just to watch it wiggle in the alley light.

"Huh? Don't say that, Sally," Matt says. "No. Say it again." He chuckles and wipes the veiny custard onto his thigh. He picks up a beer bottle, sips from it and spits out a cockroach. 

Matt nods. "That *is* all she cares about, isn't it?" He giggles. "That run-down shack of a shit-store. Right?" He guffaws. "No!" Matt drops the bottle to the ground.

Matt can't believe it. "Sally!" he says. "Do you think I should? You think I could? Shit in one of her washing machines? Hahaha you are *terrible,* Sally. Terrible." 

Matt makes a mental note to shit in one of Laundra's washing machines. 

"Oh Sally, I knew you'd understand," Matt says. "I'm so glad I found you. You know just the right things to say, don't you?"

Matt looks down at his callused, dirt-stained feet. He leans back on his heels and flexes his toes, stretching them apart as far as he can.

"You'd do that for me?" he says. "You'd give me the shoes off your feet? Well, thanks, Sally. I'll take those socks too. I knew there was something wonderful about you the moment I saw your beautiful bloated face pressed down into the gutter, half-covered with garbage. Hey--What size shoe do you wear? And where are your legs? Has something been eating you?"

Matt flings chunk after sack of garbage over his shoulder, searching for Sally's lower appendages, singing softly to himself, "Sally in the Alley."

Matt finds an UGG boot under a soggy flap of cardboard.

"Eureka!"

Matt grabs the UGG boot and tugs but it won't give. Matt scratches his head. He scratches his arms and legs. He scratches the back of his neck. 

Matt feels the plush, fuzzy feel of the UGG. He squeezes it. In the boot, there is a foot. The foot connects to an ankle. The ankle to a calf.

"I found your feet, Sally," Matt says. "At least one of them."

Matt digs around in the garbage, singing "and the shoe is on the foot, and the foot is on the calf, and the calf is in the trash, and the trash is in the trash, and the trash is in my heart ..." 

He finds another UGG. In the UGG is another foot.

One at a time, Matt uncovers Sally's legs. Her legs are mangled. Hatchet blows have destroyed the knees, severed the tendons and shattered the bones, chopped them away from the body to which they once belonged. Like Matt, the legs are broken and alone.

But her calves are smooth. And the boots look warm.

Matt scratches his dick. He kicks at Sally's feet, trying to loosen the boots so he can slip them from her severed shanks.

"Do you believe in love?" Matt asks. The smell of rot is pungent. 

Matt struggles with the boots, pinning down Sally's calves with his knee while he tugs at the UGGs until they finally slip free. 

Matt stumbles and kicks over a box. A bloody heart rolls into the gutter.

The heart twitches like a nervous rat. Matt drops the UGG boots and rubs at his eyes.

He can't tell if the heart is human or animal. It squirms, and Matt feels a squirming in his own chest. His heart feels like a plate of cockroach-infested enchiladas.

The heart flops in the gutter like a fish out of water.

Matt's heart flops along with it, smashing against his ribs. Matt doubles over, falling to his knees. He gasps for air.

Lying in the gutter on his side, Matt watches the pulsating heart slow to a rhythmic beat. He takes a deep, long breath. The pain in his chest subsides.

"Sally? Is that yours?" Matt asks. "Do hookers have hearts?" Maybe it's a pig heart. 

Matt lurches forward to pick it up. He reaches a hand out, just barely touching it with the tips of his fingers. It twitches. A big milky rat eye unfurls from a fold of flesh and stares up at Matt.

The rat unrolls and stretches and bites Matt's finger before scurrying into the garbage.

Matt jams his finger into his mouth and tongues the bite wound. He puts on the UGG boots and stands up. 

"Thanks, Sally," he says. "You've got a rat for a heart, but you are real nice."

The UGGs are comfortable but they make Matt's feet sweat. It feels like he's walking on clouds about to burst with hot rain. 

"Sweet shoes," Methuselah mutters as Matt strolls by. She spits out more blood.

Matt smiles. He holds his head up high. This is footwear for royalty. The UGG boot. 

Methuselah waves her skeletal arm at Matt. "Spare some change?" Her breast-flaps flop against her collapsed ribcage.

Matt ignores her.

"Cock-tease!" she calls after him. "Cockroach!"

His feet are burning up but he doesn't care. "I feel lighter on my feet," Matt says aloud to no one in particular.

## Matt gets a Haircut and some News <!-- STATUS: edit 3 -->

"BARBER SHOP!" Matt yells as he opens the door to the barber shop. It smells of decomposing flesh. A smoke machine is throbbing and puffing out smoke. Matt can't see anything. He coughs. 

<!-- TODO: chance for a door chime -->

"Hello?" 

Matt waves the smoke away from his face. An obese man appears as if from a dream. Matt is immediately repulsed.

"I am barber," the man says, offering his swolen hand.

Matt ignores the gesture and avoids eye contact. He looks instead at a TV mounted on the wall. It flickers seductively.

"I cut your hair," the obese barber says, smoke billowing from his gaping mouth. Sweat beads on his face and neck. Hair matted and damp.

"Flattop," Matt says. 

"I give you haircut." The obese man points to his Executioner II Barber Chair.

> The Executioner II Barber Chair features a cutting edge modern chair design. Features a heavy-duty and spacious seating area that fits any customer comfortably. A single recline lever simultaneously reclines backrest and raises footrest. Adjustable and removeable headrest. Durable construction of chair and hydraulic base makes this a favorite with barbers.

Matt sits. "This chair isn't very comfortable," he says. His shoulders are tense, hunched up around his neck. "I want a flattop."

The barber snaps his scissors. "I give you bowl cut," he says, struggling with the words as they modulate into a phlegmy coughing fit.

"I don't want a bowl cut. I want a flattop," Matt snaps. 

The barber drapes a cloth over Matt, attaching it at his neck. For a split second, the barber puts his hands around Matt's throat. He quickly releases his grip. 

"Okay, I give you flattop," the barber gurgles, swallowing the last results of his violent expectoration. 

"I want a flattop," Matt repeats. 

The barber lowers his face down to Matt's and says, quite loudly and insistently, "I give you flattop." He spins Matt around in the chair. "I cut the fuck out of you." 

Matt feels uncomfortable. He stares at the television set as the barber goes to work. 

> An obese man with blonde eyebrows and a brunette toupee dances about in a billowy wedding dress, singing in an obscene falsetto:

> "All of me ... why not take all of me?"

> Dense paragraphs of text scroll by the screen almost too fast for the eye to follow. The screen flickers. The rolling text slows, reverses and scrolls back the other way, as if someone is adjusting the V-hold. The obese male bride dances and hops and flutters without breaking his song. 

> The on screen text reads: 

>> SPARKY LAMOTT, 76, respected husband, hotelier and family man, died on Friday in the famous CLIFFSIDE GROTTO POOL at his very own FONTIS HOTEL, after a rupture in the connective tissues of the hotspring structure tore his body to pieces while he was bathing with his wife. According to a report by the medical examiner, Lamott died of "natural causes."  

>> Lamott is survived by his lovely wife Lala, 19, and his son Matthew, 35.

"Don't ever call me Matthew," Matt says. "The name's Matt." He leans forward. "I'm 35?"

>> We (the people) hereby issue a GENERAL SUMMONS for one Matthew Lamott to report to the family property for a meeting with the executor of the estate to discuss matters Post-Mortem and Fiduciary. There is a GREAT INHERITANCE at stake here. Report immediately to THE FONTIS HOTEL to proceed with the EXECUTION of the WILL and the delivery of GREAT INHERITANCE.

Matt leans back. "I hate it when people call me Matthew," he says to the barber. "Do I look 35 to you?"

"35 dollar. Nice price for nice hair, yes," the barber chortles. The jiggling wet fat of his underarms slops across Matt's shoulder.

"What? No! The sign says nine. I give you nine dollar."

"No 35?"

"No. 35 years old. 35 old? Does that sound right? Is that possible? Do you understand me?"

"Oh yes. How old? No more than 57." The barber chuckles. "Matty."

"My name is Matt," Matt says, leaning forward.

The song playing on the television draws to a close and is replaced by the rich husky voice of an announcer.

> "Come on Down, Matthew Lamott. While the Network is compassionate, and Sorry for your Loss, we are also very pleased to present you with GREAT INHERITANCE. So Come on Down to THE FONTIS HOTEL and make your claim!"

"Oooh ... your daddy dead, Matty. You no move head," the barber says, pushing Matt back into his chair. Sweat drips from the barber's lumpy, bulbous nose and splashes down into Matt's half-formed flattop. Matt can see the sweat drop in the mirror, he feels it smack his freshly exposed scalp.

"My name is Matt!" Matt shouts. "Now make my top Flat!"

The sweat drips from the barber's nose and he says "You like flattop?"

"I've been estranged from my father for so long," Matt says. "This has potential to be an emotionally impactful moment, but I'm so out of touch with myself that I feel nothing but emptiness. Laundra was right. Thank goodness I've decided to become sober and take responsibility for my own life and circumstance. Otherwise I might've missed this opportunity entirely. Perhaps the first step toward a fulfilling emotional life is the ability to recognize the absence of my own feelings."

"You shut up now. You like flattop." The Barber shields Matt's face with an outdated copy of NINJAS WITH BOOBS as he sprays product into Matt's hair, sculpting the fibers into a chunky, uneven mockery of a flattop.

Matt stands up. "Goddamn, I could really do something with all that money! My dad was quite wealthy, you know; THE FONTIS HOTEL, an institution. I could rebuild Laundra's CLOTHING CLEANING STORE. She'll never have to talk to that dick Lucius again. All I need to do is to claim my rightful inheritance. To claim my inheritance, I must face my own past and return to THE FONTIS HOTEL, the property in which I was raised up by my family, all of whom are now dead, for my father was the last living relative beknownst to me ..."

The barber hands Matt a piece of paper with a phone number on it. He caresses Matt's ear with the index finger of his left hand while he jams a horsehair brush into Matt's face with his right. "I like touching," he coos. "I touch, and touch, and touch, and ..." he is overwhelmed by a coughing fit. He hacks and sputters and folds in half, resting his hands on his knees. 

The barber waves his horsehair brush in a gentle goodbye as Matt walks out the door and into the drizzling rain, his poorly-planed flattop sparkling in the wet neon glow of SHIT CITY.
